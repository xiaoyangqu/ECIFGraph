# Water Network-Augmented Two-State Model
## ECIFGraph::HM-Holo-Apo Scoring Function

Water network rearrangement, transitioning from the ligand-unbound state to the ligand-bound state, has been shown to significantly impact protein-ligandbinding   interactions. Despite this, current machine learning-based scoring functions fail to account for these effects. Our study aims to address this challengeby incorporating water network rearrangement information into deep learning-based scoring functions for protein-ligand binding prediction.<br>
Here, we attempt to construct a comprehensive representation that incorporates water network information into both ligand-unbound and bound states. Specifically,we integrated extended connectivity interaction features into the graph representation, while employing a graph transformer operator to extract features fromboth    ligand-unbound and bound states. Consequently, we devised a water network-augmented two-state model, designated as ECIFGraph::HM-Holo-Apo, which exhibitssatisfactory performance for scoring, ranking, docking, (reverse) screening, power tests on the CASF-2016 benchmark, and superior performance in larger-scaledocking-based virtual screening tests on the DEKOIS2.0 dataset. Our study emphasizes that the use of a water network-augmented two-state model can effectivelyenhance the robustness of machine learning-based scoring functions.
